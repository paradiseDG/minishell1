# Epitech project : minishell1

You have to program a UNIX command interpreter.
The interpreter is expected to display a prompt ( $> , for example) and then wait for you to write a command
line, which must be validated by a newline.

This was a pretty difficult project, since I had diffuculties with getting the signlas, recepting them and then printing them.
With no clear plan in my head, I didn't think I could get very far, but I still worked pretty hard on it.
Unfortunately I couldn't finish it in time, but hope to get back to it someday.
